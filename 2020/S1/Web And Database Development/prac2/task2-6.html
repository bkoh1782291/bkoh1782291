	    <h1>Check out my borders</h1>
        <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>
	    <p>Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.</p>
    <hr id="hr2-6">
	    <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;<br>
    	all horizontal rules are now #9FEFE4.</p>
    	<p>Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br>
    	That prevents it from messing with the line height</p>
	</div>

    <div class="red-border-2">This div has a red border</div>
	<div class="blue-border">This div has a blue border</div>

	    <p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>

	<div class="rounded-red-border">This div has a red border, except from the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
	<div class="rounded-blue-border">This div has a blue border,and 8px round bottom corners</div>

    <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
